\todo[inline, color=yellow]{Vera und Laura}
All parts of the \textit{Interactive Lighting Detector} were implemented as a team which supported each other with their responsibilities. Laura Anger mainly focus on the development of the GUI and the least square method whereas Vera Brockmeyer did the capturing of both test image sets, build the framework and implement the contour extraction and the output of the resulting data. 

The writing of documentation is divided as follows: 

Laura Anger wrote the sections ~\ref{sec:StateOfTheArt},~\ref{sec:Materials},~\ref{sec:approaches} and \ref{sec:pm} including all subsections. 
The other parts~\ref{sec:Introduction},~\ref{sec:Motivation},~\ref{sec:Project Goal},~\ref{sec:lightingmodel},~\ref{sec:Conclusion} as well as \ref{sec:Evaluation} including all subsections.
