\section{Division of Labour } \label{sec:Division}
All parts of the \textit{Interactive Lighting Detector} were implemented as a team, which supported each other with their responsibilities. Laura Anger mainly focused on the development of the GUI and the realisation of all necessary systems of equations for the various approaches and their solution, using least square method. Vera Brockmeyer did the capturing of both test image batches, build the framework and implemented the contour extraction and the output of the resulting data. 

The writing of documentation is divided as follows: 

Laura Anger wrote the sections ~\ref{sec:StateOfTheArt},~\ref{sec:Materials},~\ref{sec:approaches}, \ref{sec:GUI} and \ref{sec:pm} including all subsections. 
The other parts~\ref{sec:Introduction},~\ref{sec:contours}-\ref{sec:lightingmodel},~\ref{sec:Evaluation} as well as~\ref{sec:Conclusion} including all subsections were written by Vera Brockmeyer.
