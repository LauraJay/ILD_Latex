\section{Conclusion and Prospect} \label{sec:Conclusion}
The project team developed a working light detection application and most of the project goals were achieved. Unfortunately, the integration of the interactive segmentation tool \textit{LiveWire} failed, because of its lack of precision and controllability. Due to the challenging project schedule, the team decided to realize a segmentation, which is based on manually created mask images. Maybe, there exists a better solution like the \textit{GraphCut} method~\cite{Rother:2004} that can be integrated into the framework and offer similar results with less user effort.

It was planned to detect light vectors for several objects to give the opportunity of comparing the directions to each other. This goal needs to be implemented in future, as well, but it is dispensable because the approach appears to be not trustworthy. Several assumptions were made in the beginning to simplify the approximation problem and cause big trouble in reality. External influences, like ignored reflections in the object's neighbourhood and the disregard of specular reflection on its surface, forge the results extremely.
